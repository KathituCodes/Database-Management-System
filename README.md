# RDBMS Project: Entity-Relationship Modeling and Database Implementation

## Project Overview
In this project, I designed an Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagram and converted it into a Relational Database Schema based on a real-world scenario. I then went further to implement the schema using PostgreSQL on DBeaver, created and populated the database tables for a Driving School System, and performed queries to extract meaningful insights.

## Scenario
The project is based on the **Motor Vehicle Branch** system, which administers driving tests and issues licenses. The key operations include:
- Conducting learner's exams and issuing learnerâ€™s licenses.
- Allowing candidates to retake exams if they fail.
- Issuing a driver's license upon successful completion of the driver's exam.
- Recording details such as license restrictions and driver's education status.

My objective was to:
1. Create an **E-R diagram** representing the system.
2. Explain the **E-R diagram** components.
3. Convert the **E-R diagram** into a **Relational Database Schema**.
4. Implement the schema in SQL (DDL - Data Definition Language).
5. Populate the database with my own sample data (DML - Data Manipulation Language).
6. Write and execute SQL queries (DQL - Data Query Language) to retrieve useful information.

## Steps Taken in the Project

### 1. Creating an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (E-R Diagram)** from the Scenario
To build the E-R diagram, I followed these steps:

1. **Identified Entities:**
2. **Determined Relationships:**
3. **Defined Attributes:**
4. **Identified Constraints:**

### 2. Explanation of the **Entity-Relationship Diagram**

### 3. Converting the **E-R Diagram into a Relational Database Schema**

#### Tables and Schema **(DDL)**
After finalising with the ER- Diagram and converting it to a relational schema I created the tables

### 4. Populating the Database **(DML)**
I then inserted sample data into the tables to test the database.

### 5. Querying the Database **(DQL)**
Finally, I wrote SQL queries to retrieve relevant data.

## Conclusion
This project provided an end-to-end experience in database design, from conceptual modeling to SQL implementation. By creating and querying the database, I ensured that the schema was well-structured and functional for real-world use cases.

## How to Use This Project
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Review the E-R diagram and schema structure.
3. Run the SQL scripts to create the database tables.
4. Populate the database using the sample data provided.
5. Execute the SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights.
